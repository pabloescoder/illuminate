# Illuminate

## About The Project

Illuminate, since it's inception, has a very straight-forward idea, which is empowering people across the world to share their current state of mind with others. 
Our mental health is very often sidelined and unlike our physical health is not given the importance it deserves, which has some severe repercussions on our lives and those of our loved one's. In 2017, a study estimated that, globally, more than one in ten people (10.7%) have some state of mental health disorder, and the worst part is that the numbers are only increasing with time.
Our platform helps people opening up, seeking help from others, helping others... With the common motive being, making the world a better place to live in.
